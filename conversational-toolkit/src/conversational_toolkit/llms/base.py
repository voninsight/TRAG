"""
Core LLM abstractions and message data models.

All concrete LLM backends ('OpenAILLM', 'OllamaLLM', 'LocalLLM') implement the 'LLM' ABC. The shared message format ('LLMMessage') is deliberately backend-agnostic so agents and the controller never need to know which LLM is in use.

'LLMMessage' doubles as the base class for 'AgentAnswer': this lets the streaming infrastructure pass partial content chunks and fully assembled agent answers through the same async-generator pipeline without additional wrappers.
